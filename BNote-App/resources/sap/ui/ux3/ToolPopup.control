    <documentation>A popup which the user can open from the Shell's tool pane. Generally, the starting point would be an icon.
For this pop up, buttons can be defined with any text; therefore, it has the same purpose
and similar look like any common dialog box.
A ToolPopup can have any content. Depending on the application type and design, the structure
of the texts and input fields can be for example form-like.</documentation>

        <method since="1.13.1" type="sap.ui.core/boolean" name="getEnabled">
            <documentation>Indicates whether the ToolPopup is currently enabled or not.

Applications can't control the enabled state via a property. A ToolPopup is implicitly
enabled depending on its &lt;code&gt;openState&lt;/code&gt;. Descendant controls that honor the
enabled state of their ancestors will appear disabled after the ToolPopup is closed.

Since 1.13.1. Whether a dialog is regarded as &quot;enabled&quot; during the state transitions
(OPENING, CLOSING) is not fully decided. Currently, it is enabled during the OPENING phase
and disabled during the CLOSING phase. The only potential change would be to treat the
OPENING phase as disabled as well. Applications should be prepared to receive events from
&quot;enabled&quot; controls after they called open() on the dialog until close() is called on it.
If the mentioned potential change should happen, the dialog will become enabled only
after the transition to OPEN. Events from &quot;enabled&quot; children then can still only arrive
between open() and close(), so applications that obey the previous rule should continue
to work. Only end users or code that explicitly triggers pseudo user events would notice
a difference. &lt;br&gt;
A second aspect that might change is the visual behavior of the content: during the CLOSING
phase it 'looks' enabled but in fact it is already disabled. This avoids unnecessary redraws
for content that becomes hidden soon. Should this show to be confusing for end users, it might
be changed.</documentation>
